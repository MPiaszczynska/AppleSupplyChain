# Supply Chain Traceability App

## Overview

This project contains a smart contract designed for a supply chain traceability application. The purpose of this contract is to enable the tracking of a product's journey from the farmer to the end customer, ensuring transparency, reliability, and security through the use of blockchain technology.

## Features

- **End-to-End Traceability:** The smart contract facilitates the seamless tracking of a product's entire supply chain journey, allowing stakeholders to trace its origin, processing, and distribution.
- **Blockchain Technology:** All transactions and relevant data are securely stored on a blockchain, ensuring immutability, transparency, and reliability. This decentralized approach enhances the integrity of the supply chain data.
- **Smart Contract Security:** The smart contract is designed with security in mind, utilizing best practices to protect against vulnerabilities and unauthorized access. It ensures that only authorized parties can participate in and validate transactions.
- **Immutable Data:** Once recorded on the blockchain, the data becomes immutable, providing an unalterable record of every transaction in the supply chain. This feature enhances accountability and trust among participants.
- **Transparency:** Through the use of blockchain, all stakeholders have transparent access to the product's journey. This transparency fosters accountability and helps build trust between different entities in the supply chain.
